<h2>Welcome to Human Assisted Shopping</h2>
<p>A common man who doesn't understand the technical specifications well is still preferring offline shopping more than online shopping because he plans that he could get some suggestions/guidance from the sales person, take feedback modify thoughts and finally choose a better product.
    <br/>
    Yes, there are reviews and comments sections for every product. But honestly how many customers do actually invest time in studying them all? And also these comments are generally made in a wide sense without concentrating on any specific requirements. But everyone has their own interests, requirements and constraints which even change from locality to locality also. So the suggestions should be specific which can be easily made by an human in the other end if could know some of the consumer's requirements and mentality.
    <br/>
    So, my idea is to provide a human assisted shopping experience to the common man, if he needs.
    <br/>
    This can be done like introducing a intermediary website between companies and customers. This site should list the profiles of available employees including their locality. So the customer will choose one based on his requirement and locality because the mentality of a consumer over a set of products changes from locality to locality. Then our website person chosen will contact the customer through his preferred mode on communication like live chat/ phone/ online call and give appropriate suggestions. And also the consumer should give the limited rights to extract his social networking information from facebook etc. about his interests and the website should be made in such a way it summarizes all the information from social networking sites and produce a report to the employee on the other side at every request for suggestion so that he could make an consumer specific suggestion.
    <br/>
    The intermediary website can collect some money for providing the suggestions  like 2% of the product value or some fixed amount for purchases above a minimum value.
    <br/>
    Pros: This decreases the amount of time spent in browsing on consumers side. Also we can recruit students and offer part -time jobs because these are the ones who usually have the knowledge of broad range of products.
    <br/>
    Cons: Ofcourse the sales could give a biased suggestion and cheat the consumer but this whole system works only with some trust which should be build up over a period of time.
